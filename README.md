# deep-learning-specialization



Welcome to my Deep Learning Assignments Showcase! This repository serves as a showcase of assignments completed during my studies in deep learning specialization by deeplearning.ai . It provides a glimpse into the practical knowledge and skills I have acquired through these courses, making it a valuable resource for potential recruiters and anyone interested in my deep-learning expertise.

## Courses

The assignments in this repository represent my journey through the following five courses:

1. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
2. **Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization**
3. **Structuring Machine Learning Projects**
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks**
5. **Sequence Models**

## Learning Highlights

Throughout these courses, I have gained proficiency in the following areas:

- Building and training neural networks for various tasks.
- Optimizing model performance through hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques.
- Structuring machine learning projects for efficient development and deployment.
- Designing and implementing convolutional neural networks for image-related tasks.
- Leveraging sequence models for natural language processing and time-series analysis.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to showcase my assignments and the skills I have honed in each course:

- `Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning/`: Assignments from the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course.
- `Improving_Deep_Neural_Networks/`: Assignments from the Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization course.
- `Structuring_Machine_Learning_Projects/`: Assignments from the Structuring Machine Learning Projects course.
